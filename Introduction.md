# AppProject
This is an Initial test for me when I recently applied to a Company.
The project is about a specific product, a launching mobile game. The purpose of the project is to find out new insights for the product development team.
Question number 1 and number 2 (Power BI and Python) care about users' ads viewing status, while the other looking for real data to support a need.
